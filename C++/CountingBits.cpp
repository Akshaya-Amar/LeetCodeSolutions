/*

3rd Approach (more optimized than 2nd approach based on observation of the pattern formed)

A number can be either even or odd, and
Last bit of even number is 0 and odd number is 1

decimal  binary
  1   -->   1 (1 set bit)
  2   -->   10 (1 set bit)
  3   -->   11 (2 set bits)
  4   -->   100 (1 set bit)
  5   -->   101 (2 set bits)
  6   -->   110 (2 set bits)
  7   -->   111 (3 set bits)
  8   -->   1000 (1 set bit)
  9   -->   1001 (2 set bits)
  10  -->  1010 (2 set bits)

when number is even
suppose x = 6, now x / 2 = 3, here number of bits in x(i.e. 6) are 2 and set bits in x / 2(i.e. 3) are also 2
so, we can say that when number is even, number of bits in x = number of bits in (x / 2)

and when number is odd
suppose x = 9, now x - 1 = 8, here number of set bits in x(i.e. 9) are 2 and set bits in x - 1(i.e. 8) are 1
so, we can say that when number is odd, number of bits in x = number of bits in (x - 1) + 1

Based on this observation, we can solve this problem in O(n)

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n), vector of size n is required

class Solution {
public:
  vector<int> countBits(int n) {

    vector<int> res(n + 1);
    res[0] = 0;

    for(int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {

      if((i & 1) == 0) { // equivalent to (i % 2 == 0) to check whether the number is even or odd
        res[i] = res[i >> 1]; // (i >> 1) is equivalent to (i / 2)
      } else {
        res[i] = res[i - 1] + 1;
      }
    }

    return res;
  }

4th Approach (more optimized than 3rd approach also based on observation)

A number can be either even or odd, and
Last bit of even number is 0 and odd number is 1

decimal  binary
  1   -->   1 (1 set bit)
  2   -->   10 (1 set bit)
  3   -->   11 (2 set bits)
  4   -->   100 (1 set bit)
  5   -->   101 (2 set bits)
  6   -->   110 (2 set bits)
  7   -->   111 (3 set bits)
  8   -->   1000 (1 set bit)
  9   -->   1001 (2 set bits)
  10  -->  1010 (2 set bits)

when number is even
suppose x = 6, now x / 2 = 3, here number of bits in x(i.e. 6) are 2 and set bits in x / 2(i.e. 3) are also 2
so, we can say that when number is even, number of bits in x = number of bits in (x / 2)

and when number is odd
suppose x = 9, now x / 2 = 4, here number of set bits in x(i.e. 9) are 2, but set bits in x / 2(i.e. 4) are 1
so, we can say that when number is odd, number of bits in x = number of bits in (x / 2) + 1

Based on this observation, we can solve this problem in O(n)
